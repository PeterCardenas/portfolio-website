Hi! Welcome to my portfolio website repository. I created this website with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and it's currently deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## How to Personalize

If you'd like to personalize this app for with your own portfolio, follow these steps:

- Go to `utils/profile.json` to change my information with your information.
- Any image assets for project previews, or company logos should go into `public/images/` with their names changed in `utils/profile.json`
- Replace my resume with yours at `public/resume.pdf`
- Finally, if you have your own logo, resize it and convert it to a .ico file with [this](https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-ico) and replace `public/favicon.ico` with it.
